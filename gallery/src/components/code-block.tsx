/**
 * CodeBlock: code in an answer, in a tool's output, or a diff (components.md, "Code block").
 *
 * - Surface: `--surface-2` with an inset `--line` hairline at the surface radius, drawn as an overlay so a
 *   changed line's band never paints over it. A 32px header holds the file name or the language in mono at
 *   the caption size in `--fg-subtle`, and the Copy button. The header is its own row, so the button can never
 *   cover code. The file name is at the interface weight (550). The code is mono at the small size and the text
 *   weight (450) in `--fg`, padded `--space-4`, with a tab size of 2.
 * - Highlighting: tsx, ts, jsx and js go through sugar-high, and every other language is plain. Code is not
 *   data, so the colors are the foreground's tones and the accent text for strings (no data hues, P11).
 *   sugar-high paints each token with a syntax variable, so this file declares all of them on the block
 *   itself with arbitrary properties. It needs no stylesheet from the gallery and ships alone.
 * - Diff: with lang "diff" each line's first character is its sign, read into its own column: `+` in
 *   `--success`, `-` in `--danger`. Added lines are `--fg`, removed lines `--fg-subtle`, and both changed kinds
 *   take an fg 4% band that runs the whole scroll width (each row owns the side padding, so the band reaches
 *   the edges). Status color stays on the sign. Diff lines are not syntax-highlighted, so a removed line can
 *   step back to `--fg-subtle`. Header lines before the first hunk (`diff`, `---`, `+++`) and `@@` lines show
 *   as quiet text with no sign.
 * - Screen readers: the sign column is hidden from them and a changed line starts with hidden words, "Added:"
 *   or "Removed:". Color and glyphs are never the only signal. The hidden words cannot be selected, so a hand
 *   selection never picks them up.
 * - Line numbers: an optional gutter in mono at the caption size in `--fg-subtle`. It is hidden from screen
 *   readers, cannot be selected, and is not part of Copy.
 * - Overflow: lines scroll sideways inside the block (`wrap` wraps them), and a block taller than `maxHeight`
 *   scrolls down. The scroller is focusable and named by `label`, so a keyboard can scroll it.
 * - Copy: the button copies `code` exactly as given, a diff with its signs included. It swaps its icon for a
 *   check at once, and a polite live region says "Copied". No toast.
 * - Touch: the header and the button grow to 44px on a coarse pointer.
 * - Focus: the scroller and the Copy button both draw the 2px focus ring inside themselves, because the button
 *   fills the header's height and an outer ring would run past the block's edge.
 * - Motion: none. The copy icon swaps at once.
