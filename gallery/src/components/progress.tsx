/**
 * Progress: how far along something is that is happening now, such as an upload, an import or a build
 * (components.md, "Progress"). A Meter shows a quantity against a limit and stands still; Progress moves while the
 * work goes on, then ends done or failed.
 *
 * - Anatomy: the Meter's lockup. The label at the small size in --fg, the reading at the end in tabular figures at the caption
 *   size in --fg-subtle ("3.2 of 8 MB", or the percent), and under them a slot cut into the page (R3, material.md 6: a
 *   slot is what fills), 8px tall at the control radius: the floor --slot, the done part in it in --fg. The walls
 *   (--slot-shade: the top one's shade, the lit lower one) are drawn on a layer above the fill, so the fill sits down in
 *   the channel instead of covering its walls. Never the accent and never a data hue: it is one quantity.
 * - Ending: done fills the slot and the reading says "Done"; failed keeps the fill where it stopped, in --danger (a status
 *   mark, which R7 allows), and the reading says "Failed". A message under the slot says the rest (what failed and what
 *   to do, or the time left).
 * - Not known yet: with no value the slot stays empty and the reading says so in words ("Waiting"). Nothing moves on its
 *   own: no stripes, no shimmer, no sweep. A wait that has no end in sight is a spinner in a button, not a slot.
 * - Motion: the done part is a full-width band scaled from the left, so only a transform changes, on the instant tier,
 *   which keeps up with a value that updates often. Its end is square: a radius would squash with the scale. Under
 *   reduced motion it jumps.
 * - Forced colors drops the walls and the floor, so the slot gets a real border and the fill takes CanvasText.
 * - Accessibility: role="progressbar", named by the label, with aria-valuenow while the value is known and the reading
 *   as aria-valuetext. Ending done or failed is said once in a polite status, so a long wait need not be watched.
