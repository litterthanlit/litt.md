/**
 * Card: a raised surface for one independent object that links somewhere, such as a client site, a
 * build or an invoice. It is a few small parts you compose: Card, CardCover, CardBody, CardTitle,
 * CardDescription and CardLink.
 *
 * - Surface (components.md, Card): `.litt-raised`. The surface radius, surface-1, an inset hairline and the
 *   top highlight, and no outer shadow (P4). Never glass (P3), never an accent rail.
 * - Padding follows the cover. A plain card pads space-6. With an inset cover the card pads space-1 (4px),
 *   the cover takes the control radius (4 + 4 = 8, so the corners nest) and CardBody pads space-4 above and
 *   at the sides, space-3 below. With a bleed cover the card pads nothing, the cover runs to the edges and
 *   takes the card's surface radius at the top, and CardBody pads space-6. Card tells its parts which one it is.
 * - A linked card holds one real link or button (CardLink), stretched over the whole card by its ::after.
 *   That keeps the semantics right (the title is the accessible name, the card is one tab stop) without
 *   wrapping block content in an <a>. Anything else clickable inside the card sits above it with `relative`.
 * - Hover (instant tier, color only): a linked card's fill moves one step, surface-1 to surface-2, and its
 *   cover steps to surface-3 so it keeps its edge. No lift, no shadow growth, no scale; the box never moves.
 *   An unlinked card has no hover. Touch loses nothing, because hover reveals nothing.
 * - Focus by modality: :focus-visible on the link draws the 2px focus ring around the whole card, at a 2px
 *   offset, and the link's own outline is removed so the two never stack.
 * - Light: `lit` adds `.litt-lit .litt-grain` as the card's own top light. It is optional and static (P5).
 *   The page already has one light source (P2), so use it on one card, not on a set.
 * - Motion: none of its own. The entrance cascade for a set of cards belongs to the page (see List and cards).
 * - Forced colors (Windows high contrast) drops box-shadow and turns fills to Canvas. The card and its cover
 *   take a real border (a bleed cover only its bottom edge). The hover step is a fill, so it has no cue there.
