/**
 * Breadcrumb: where a page sits. Studio / Projects / Marlow Labs / Settings.
 *
 * - Anatomy: a nav landmark (named "Breadcrumb" by default) holding an ordered list on one line. Each level is a
 *   link at the small size in fg-muted that turns fg on hover, on the instant tier, color only, with no underline.
 *   The last level is the current page: fg, not a link, with aria-current="page", and it truncates with an
 *   ellipsis instead of wrapping. Between levels a "/" in fg-subtle with --space-2 each side, hidden from screen
 *   readers. No dots, no chevrons (a chevron reads as "opens"), no accent.
 * - Targets: a link's hit area is 32px tall, and 44px on coarse pointers. The extra height is an invisible layer
 *   around the link (::before), so the text never moves and the row keeps its height.
 * - Long trails: past maxVisible levels (four) the middle ones fold into an icon-only ghost sm "…" button (a pill)
 *   named "Show 3 more levels", which opens litt's Menu of them, in order. The first level and the last three
 *   stay. On compact screens (useDevice().compact) only the last two levels show and the rest fold.
 * - Router: links are plain <a> unless you pass renderLink, as the Header takes it (data items, so a function
 *   draws each link). The folded levels are real links in the Menu (MenuItem href) unless you pass onNavigate.
 * - Motion: none. The Menu that holds the folded levels owns its own, on the responsive tier.
